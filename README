Semantic Debian
===============

This repository holds the code that is used to run the service at: 
http://rdf.debian.net

Semantic Debian is written in Python and translates data from UDD into RDF.

The update-from-udd.py script generates a file semdeb.ttl containing the full
RDF graph.

Individual resources can be queried using the classes found in the
semantic_debian.resources module.
